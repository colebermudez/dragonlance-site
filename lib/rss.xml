 <br><br>Slowly but surely, Krynn's Vanguard worked their way through the city, taking down key Kingdom targets in <a class="internal-link" data-href="NPCs/Holy Kingdom of Solamnia/Ingrid Brandl Galatea.md" href="https://krynns-vanguard.com/npcs/holy-kingdom-of-solamnia/ingrid-brandl-galatea.html" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ingrid</a> and <a class="internal-link" data-href="NPCs/Holy Kingdom of Solamnia/Gwendal Roche.md" href="https://krynns-vanguard.com/npcs/holy-kingdom-of-solamnia/gwendal-roche.html" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Gwendal</a>. With 4 of their 5 major targets taken out, they set their sights on <a class="internal-link" data-href="NPCs/Holy Kingdom of Solamnia/Cornelia Arnim.md" href="https://krynns-vanguard.com/npcs/holy-kingdom-of-solamnia/cornelia-arnim.html" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Cornelia</a>.<br>Along the way, Krynn's Vanguard gained two allies in <a data-href="Arcadius" href="https://krynns-vanguard.com/krynns-vanguard/arcadius.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Arcadius</a> returning after a small detour on his own journey and a friend that showed up with him, <a data-href="Nebula" href="https://krynns-vanguard.com/krynns-vanguard/nebula.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Nebula</a>. It's unclear where the two went and how they came to find Krynn's Vanguard again, but that's a conversation for once the fight is over.<br>Pushing forward and taking out the front guard, Krynn's Vanguard has come face-to-face with the Titanus. Gargantuan constructs of massive power that are as durable as they are powerful. These large magical robots are able to land powerful strikes and even grapple a creature and continuously crush them in their grip. They are accompanied by somewhat powerful mages. Putting a dent in Krynn's Vanguard's forces, <a class="internal-link" data-href="NPCs/The Black Eagles/Lindhardt Von Hevring.md" href="https://krynns-vanguard.com/npcs/the-black-eagles/lindhardt-von-hevring.html" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Lindhardt</a> and <a class="internal-link" data-href="NPCs/The Black Eagles/Caspar Von Bergliez.md" href="https://krynns-vanguard.com/npcs/the-black-eagles/caspar-von-bergliez.html" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Capsar</a> popped out of existence being banished. They should at least be safe but it does slow them down. This isn't helped when <a class="internal-link" data-href="Krynns Vanguard/Valphire Roseblood.md" href="https://krynns-vanguard.com/krynns-vanguard/valphire-roseblood.html" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Valphire</a> was knocked unconcious but was thankfully helped by Arcadius swooping in with his Griffin and saving the day. With them closing in, Cornelia is becoming a bit more active. Rather than just throwing out an Ice Storm in their general direction, her attacks are becoming more targeted. <br>Bound to be a hard fought battle and the prospect of death staring them in them down, can Krynn's Vanguard escape Relgoth unscathed?]]></description><link>https://krynns-vanguard.com/session-notes/25.-november-16th,-2024-the-silver-maiden.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Session Notes/25.
