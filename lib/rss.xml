 <br><img alt="Ludwig.jpg" src="https://krynns-vanguard.com/lib/media/ludwig.jpg"><br>
Personality Traits: Proud, authoritative, and pragmatic. Ludwig commands respect and carries himself with an air of nobility and power.<br>Ideals: Order and tradition. He believes in maintaining the established social order and upholding the traditions of the Abanasinian Empire.<br>Bonds: Loyal to the Empire and his family, particularly his son, <a class="internal-link" data-href="NPCs/The Black Eagles/Ferdinand Von Aegir.md" href="https://krynns-vanguard.com/npcs/the-black-eagles/ferdinand-von-aegir.html" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ferdinand</a>. He has complex relationships with other noble houses.<br>Flaws: Stubborn and power-hungry. Ludwig is resistant to change and often prioritizes his own power and status over the needs of others.<br>Backstory: Ludwig von Aegir was the Prime Minister of the Abanasinian Empire and the head of House Aegir, one of the most powerful noble families in the Empire. Known for his political acumen and influence, Ludwig has played a key role in maintaining the stability and traditions of the Empire. He is a strict and demanding father to Ferdinand, expecting him to uphold the family's prestigious legacy. Ludwig's ambition and desire for power often put him at odds with other nobles and the ruling family, particularly after Edelgard ascends to the throne. His resistance to Edelgard's reforms and his own machinations for power create tension within the Empire, setting the stage for the conflicts to come. As of current, he is being held on very strict house arrest within the Empire and has been stripped of his duties as Prime Minister. None of this is known to the people of the Empire.]]></description><link>https://krynns-vanguard.com/npcs/abanasinian-empire/ludwig-von-aegir.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">NPCs/Abanasinian Empire/Ludwig Von Aegir.md</guid><pubDate>Sun, 06 Oct 2024 22:55:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://krynns-vanguard.com/lib/media/ludwig.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="https://krynns-vanguard.com/lib/media/ludwig.jpg"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Volkhard Von Arundel]]></title><description><![CDATA[
